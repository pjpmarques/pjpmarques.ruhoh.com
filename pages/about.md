I'm the CTO of [FeedZai](http://www.feedzai.com) of which I'm also a founding partner. FeedZai is a high-tech software company that develops and commercializes a product called FeedZai Pulse(TM). Pulse allows processing large volumes of data with very low latency producing actable information in real time. I'm responsible for overall product development, technology strategy and its smooth and effective implementation.  Pulse is one of the coolest pieces of technology we have ever produced! I'm really proud of both Pulse and my team.

Before founding FeedZai I was an Assistant Professor at the [University of Coimbra](http://www.uc.pt/en) and an Adjunct Associate Teaching Professor at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu). I was also the Director of the CMU|Portugal Professional  Program in Software Engineering. Over the years I have lead and worked in a large number of projects for institutions like the European Space Agency, Microsoft Research, Critical-Software, Siemens, SciSys, among others. 

I'm passioned not only by science and technology but also by learning and teaching. One of the greatest pleasures is live is learning something afresh, something new. The other is sharing it with another person.
